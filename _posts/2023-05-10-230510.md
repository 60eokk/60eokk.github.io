title: "Developing my Portfolio...Starting Late but Never LATE"
---

What should I SHOW in my portfolio? 
Coding skills? Ideas? 내 강점이 뭐야? 솔직히 쌩코딩으로는 난 경쟁력이 없어, 솔직하게. 

DEFINE my goal
what do I want to achieve through my portfolio?
There are two ways 
1. 수익형 모델 (아마도 처음에는 거의 돈 못벎)
2. 포트폴리오 뽐내기. 실력 show to employer

Choose platform
app/web/PWA
app(Java/Kotlin for android), (swiftUI, objective-C for ios), (reactNative, Flutter, Xamarin for both)
web(html,css,js for frontend), Python with webframework(Flash or Django for server side programming), (Nodejs, RubyonRails, PHP)


MY STRENGTH:
I am good at reading trends, FULL of ideas

MY WEAKNESS:
cannot make an app. but WILL. 

그래서 결국, 너의 포폴은, 너의 작업물은 무엇이냐?

1. Web browser plug-ins: These are developed using technologies such as JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, along with browser-specific APIs. Examples include browser extensions for Google Chrome or Mozilla Firefox.
2. WordPress plug-ins: WordPress plug-ins are written in PHP and use WordPress APIs to extend or modify the functionality of WordPress-powered websites.
3. esktop application plug-ins: These can be written in various programming languages, such as C, C++, Python, or Java, depending on the host application's compatibility. Examples include plug-ins for Adobe Photoshop or Microsoft Visual Studio.

Let's first start with OPENAI's API

1. Research the GPT-3 API: Start by familiarizing yourself with the GPT-3 API documentation provided by OpenAI. This will help you understand the API's capabilities and how to interact with it.
2. Choose a host application: Select an application or platform for which you want to create the plug-in. This could be a web browser extension, a WordPress plug-in, or a plug-in for a desktop application.
3. Design your plug-in: Plan the features and functionality you want your plug-in to provide, and decide how the GPT-3 API can be used to achieve those goals. For example, you could create a browser extension that uses GPT-3 to generate text summaries of web pages or a WordPress plug-in that generates relevant blog post ideas based on user input.
4. Obtain an API key: Apply for an API key from OpenAI. This key will be used to authenticate your requests to the GPT-3 API.
5. Develop your plug-in: Write the code for your plug-in using the appropriate programming languages and technologies, depending on the host application or platform. Make sure to include code for handling API calls and processing the returned data from the GPT-3 API.
6. Test your plug-in: Thoroughly test your plug-in to ensure it works as expected and follows the guidelines and requirements of the host application or platform.
7. Publish and distribute: Once your plug-in is ready, publish it according to the distribution guidelines for the chosen platform, such as the Chrome Web Store for browser extensions or the WordPress Plugin Repository for WordPress plug-ins.
8. Remember to adhere to OpenAI's usage policies and guidelines when using the GPT-3 API and consider any additional requirements or limitations imposed by the host application or platform.
