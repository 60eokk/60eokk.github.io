The document presents a novel cell-average based neural network method for solving hyperbolic and parabolic partial differential equations (PDEs). This method integrates machine learning with traditional finite volume methods to predict the evolution of solution averages over time, without the need for explicit discretization of spatial variables. It's designed to overcome limitations of classical numerical methods, such as the CFL condition for time step size, by allowing for larger time steps without sacrificing accuracy or introducing significant numerical diffusion. The approach shows promise in accurately capturing shock waves and rarefaction waves in nonlinear hyperbolic conservation laws, as well as in solving the heat equation with first-order convergence observed. The method is mesh-dependent and uses offline supervised training to optimize network parameters, making it a potentially powerful tool for solving PDEs more efficiently.
