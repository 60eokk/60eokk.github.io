title: "Rate Limits in svelte-app"

Good website to check two codes using chatGPT (original vs GPT code)

Another problem I had was that the svelte-app stopped fetching data a few minutes later.
I added a few functions to see what the problem was.

This functino basically just counted each output on which number output they were.

The second function that was included was

This output memory usage of rss, heap, external and arraybuffers. 
Normally, when there is a memory leak, the number of rss or heap increases and does not decrease.
This memory output was printed every cycle.

Later, I found out that memory was not a problem.
The problem was with rate limits.
