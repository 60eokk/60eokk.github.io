Was looking through the code because the extension sites were NOT working.

The problem was with how the server handled the paths.
The above method is used when using "express.js"

The app.get function defines a catch-all route. The * acts as a wild card that matches any route path--> meaning any GET request regardless of its path, that is NOT handled by previous path handlers will be caught by this function.
