Why Typescript?
Safety. People used JS for along time, however, "type safety" gives us very good developer experience.
Much less bugs, minimize runtime errors, we become more productive.

JS is very flexible, in the way that it tries to help developer even if they are doing something stupid.
We have "types", numvers, boolenas , strings, data structrurs (arrays), objects, etc.
However, JS is flexible and tries very hard to NOT show errors. So even if the developer is doing something incorrect, they will try their best to get results out. 

For programming langauges like C, C#, Java, etc, the programming language is a "compiler" and when I finish the code, and RUN it, it will turn it into maybe an assmebly code, or 0s and 1s. 
However for TS, when I RUN it, the code becomes JS. 

TS secures the type before turning it into JS.

Implicit VS Explicit
Implicit means we do not write the specific types down, and thus we make TS infer, while explicit means we write it down.
It is good to keep things implicitly, but there are times when we need to use expliciitly like below. 
Below, I wanted to make an array of strings [1,2,3], but TS thought it is a number array, so when I type c.push("3)", it causes an error.
