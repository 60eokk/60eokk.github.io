axios.get(): axios is a popular library for making HTTP requests in Node.js. The get method is used to make a GET request to a specified URL, and it returns a Promise.

then() and catch(): These are methods that are called on a Promise. then is called when the Promise is resolved (i.e., the HTTP request was successful), and catch is called when the Promise is rejected (i.e., there was an error with the HTTP request).

response.data: When axios.get resolves, it provides a response object. This object contains various information about the HTTP response, and data is the actual data returned by the server.

console.log() and console.error(): These are methods provided by the console object in JavaScript. console.log is used to print information to the console (useful for debugging), and console.error is used to print error messages.

require(): This is a built-in function in Node.js that's used to import modules. In this case, it's used to import the axios library so that you can use it in your script.

async and await: These are keywords in JavaScript that are used to work with asynchronous operations like HTTP requests. async is used to declare an asynchronous function, and await is used to wait for a Promise to resolve or reject.

.env file is used to store environment variables, which are read by your program at runtime.
By storing sensitive data, NOT in the source code, we can keep it safe.

dotenv loads .env file into the process.env

If you request too many information to the server, it will give a "Error: Error: read ECONNRESET" error, which typically means the connection was forcibly closed by the remote host. This could happen for a variety of reasons. In the context of making API requests, one possible reason is that the server is rate limiting your requests.
To solve this, we use an async/await pattern in a for...of loop to ensure that we wait for one API request and delay to complete before starting the next one. This should help you respect the API's rate limits and avoid the ECONNRESET error.
The delay of 1000 milliseconds (1 second) is just an example, and you may need to adjust it depending on Kraken's actual rate limits. Please check the Kraken API documentation for details on their rate limits.
