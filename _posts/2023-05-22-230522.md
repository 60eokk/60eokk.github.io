In JavaScript, Promises and async/await are used to handle asynchronous operations. These might be operations that take some time to complete, such as network requests, file system operations, or timers.

Promises: A Promise is an object that represents a value which may not be available yet. It's essentially a placeholder for the result of an asynchronous operation.

A Promise is in one of three states:

Pending: The Promise's outcome hasn't yet been determined because the asynchronous operation that will produce its result hasn't completed yet.
Fulfilled: The asynchronous operation has completed, and the Promise has a resulting value.
Rejected: The asynchronous operation failed, and the Promise will never be fulfilled. In the rejected state, a Promise has a reason that indicates why the operation failed.
Promises are usually used with two methods, .then() and .catch(). The .then() method is used to schedule a callback function that will be called when the Promise is fulfilled, or if the Promise is already fulfilled. The .catch() method is used to handle any errors that might have occurred while the Promise was being executed.

Async/Await: The async/await syntax is a way to work with Promises in a more comfortable fashion. The syntax is clean and easy to understand. It makes asynchronous code look and behave a little more like synchronous code.

Here's how it works:

async keyword: When placed before a function, it ensures that the function returns a Promise. If the function returns a value that is not a Promise, JavaScript automatically wraps it in a resolved Promise with that value.
await keyword: It can only be used inside an async function and makes JavaScript pause until the Promise returns a result (is fulfilled), and then resumes the execution of the async function, returning the resolved value.

In this example, the await keyword is used to pause the execution of the getBitcoinPrice function until the axios.get function returns a Promise. Once the Promise is resolved, its value is assigned to the response variable.

Async/await helps in writing cleaner code and managing the flow of the program, especially when dealing with multiple asynchronous operations. The try/catch block is used for error handling in async/await syntax.
