Node.js: Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform, back-end JavaScript runtime environment that runs on the V8 engine and executes JavaScript code outside a web browser. Node.js lets developers use JavaScript to write command line tools and for server-side scriptingâ€”running scripts server-side to produce dynamic web page content before the page is sent to the user's web browser.

Node.js is primarily used for building fast, scalable network applications, thanks to its event-driven, non-blocking I/O model. It's especially good for real-time applications, such as live chat and gaming servers, collaborative tools, and streaming services.

Node.js also has a vast ecosystem of libraries (npm or Node Package Manager) which can be easily installed and used in your programs, making it a very flexible tool for developers.
