"Rust" is a low level programming language, which is silmiar to C.
It focuses on safety and performance, 

For Rust, C, there is no "middleman" between computer and code, because the processor will read the code directly. 
For other languages like Python, JS, java, the compiler for Python is C, for JS it is browser which is C or C++.

In low level languages, you normally have to deal with "memory" yourself.

Talking about speed, C (shortest) < C++ < Rust. But not much difference.
Talking about safety, C > C, C++. 
Thus, many companies prefer C. 
Rust has a concept called "ownership", which is fundamental in understanding and learning Rust.
To understand the concept above, think like this: when var1 is assigned, and it another var2 is assigned to the same one, instead of copying the data, the data is "moved". So the data would not exist in var1 anymore.

Rust is used in MANY, VARIOUS ways. But it is recommended, focused on backend, games, blockchain.

"Go" is faster than Python, JS. They are compared with each other often.
If you are looking for "developer speed", Go is the answer. If you are looking for "compiler speed", Rust is the answer.
