A LOT OF NEW THINGS ABOUT NODE.JS, LINUX, SVELTE LEARNED TODAY


1. cd is used to direct to a certain directory.
for example, if I was in tradingBotCrypto, and I used pwd it will output files under tradingBotCrypto.
if I did cd svelte-app, it will direct me to svelte-app INSIDE tradingBoyCrypto. 
cd .. will direct me to the "before" folder.

If I want to run node app.js, which is under tradingBotCrypto, I need to be at that directory in terminal.
If I want to npm run dev, which is under svelte-app, I need to be in that directory in terminal.

For me, I need to be using port 3000 and port 8080 at the same time. 
Thus, I would have to use a new terminal for each different directory terminals.

lsof -i :3000 command is used to see whether port 3000 is being used or not. 
If it is, I woudl use kill -9 PID command to get rid of it and run it again to reuse the port.
