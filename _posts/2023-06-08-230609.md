A LOT OF NEW THINGS ABOUT NODE.JS, LINUX, SVELTE LEARNED TODAY


1. cd is used to direct to a certain directory.
for example, if I was in tradingBotCrypto, and I used pwd it will output files under tradingBotCrypto.
if I did cd svelte-app, it will direct me to svelte-app INSIDE tradingBoyCrypto. 
cd .. will direct me to the "before" folder.

If I want to run node app.js, which is under tradingBotCrypto, I need to be at that directory in terminal.
If I want to npm run dev, which is under svelte-app, I need to be in that directory in terminal.

For me, I need to be using port 3000 and port 8080 at the same time. 
Thus, I would have to use a new terminal for each different directory terminals.

lsof -i :3000 command is used to see whether port 3000 is being used or not. 
If it is, I woudl use kill -9 PID command to get rid of it and run it again to reuse the port.

Later, I bumped into a problem where the localhost8080 started outputting "nothing" for the data.
This was due to either of the 5 problems.
1) Check your server logs for any errors.
2) Try logging the size of botResults over time to see if it's growing uncontrollably.
3) Monitor your server's memory usage to see if it's increasing over time, which could indicate a memory leak.
4) Check the browser console for any error messages when the data stops displaying.
5) Try adding error handling to the fetch function in your Svelte app, and log any errors that occur.

to solve the problems above. I needed to do the following, respectively.
1) Check your server logs: When you run your server with node app.js, it logs output to the console. This is where you would see any error messages. If an unhandled exception occurs in your code, it will likely be printed here.
2) Log the size of botResults over time: You can log the size of the botResults array in your Node.js server code with console.log. You can place this log in your fetchCurrentPriceAndTrade function to check the size of botResults each time it is updated.

3) Monitor your server's memory usage: You can check your Node.js process's memory usage with process.memoryUsage(). This function returns an object with information about the memory usage of the Node.js process measured in bytes.

4) Check the browser console for any error message: You can open the browser console by right-clicking on your webpage, selecting 'Inspect' or 'Inspect Element', then navigating to the 'Console' tab. Any JavaScript errors or log output from your Svelte app will appear here.
5) Try adding error handling to the fetch function of your Svelte app: To do this, you can add a .catch block to your fetch call in your Svelte app, like this:
