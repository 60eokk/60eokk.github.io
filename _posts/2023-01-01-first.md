title: "The Very First Big Step as a Developer"

    This is the first ever page, blog that was created by Jiwon Jung. 
    I decided to make this page, because I wanted to get track of what I am learning, 
    keep track of what I know and do not know, and NEVER forget.

    I can always come back here, set my motivations up again. 
    Never forget what I started for, why I need to keep going.
